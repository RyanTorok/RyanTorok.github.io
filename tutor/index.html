    <p>I am excited to offer evening and weekend Computer Science tutoring at
    Harvard University, MIT, Northeastern University, Boston College, and Boston
    University. I offer in-person sessions one or two days per week at each
    university, and remote sessions are available 7 days a week to all
      university students enrolled in Computer Science classes.<br>

        <b>About Me</b><br>
        
        <br>
    Hi! My name is Ryan Torok, and I work for zeroRISC, a startup company in
    Boston developing a cloud security service for the OpenTitan project. I hold
    a Master's degree in Computer Science from Princeton University and a
    Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas. I am
    interested in all things related to computer security and systems. In 2023,
    I gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPZMdLQu1tw">this talk</a>
    at IEEE Security Conference about my research paper I authored
    with <a href="https://amitlevy.com">Amit Levy</a> at Princeton about a novel
    defense against privacy attacks in web browsers. When I'm not working on
    CS-related business, I enjoy playing the cello, composing music, running,
    and hiking.

        <br>
      My specialty is in Computer Security and Computer Systems, including
      Operating Systems, Distributed Systems, and Networking. However, I have
      ample proficiency to teach in nearly all areas of Computer Science,
        including:

        <b>What is my teaching philosophy?</b><br>
        <br>
        Coding is intimidating. College is intimidating. Life is
        intimidating. Asking for help shouldn't be.
        <br>
        <br>
        As a self-proclaimed veteran of five TA roles at Princeton University
        and the University of Texas, I have always found my students have
        learned best when they felt the freedom to ask questions, get stuck, ask me
        to discuss their ideas about how to get un-stuck, and then use the
        process through which we come up with a solution as a learning tool to
        solve future problems.
        <br>
        <br>
        I seldom view finishing an assignment or passing an exam as an end goal
        for my students. When I walk a student through the solution to a
        problem, I use the problem as a tool demonstrate the <i>why</i> behind
        the solution. Why does a particular algorithm work? Why does a block of
        code behave the way it does? Why did a particular issue with a piece of
        code break the solution? By discussing these types of questions during
        one-on-one sessions, I observe that students are much less likely to
        repeat mistakes, and much more likely to be able to reproduce the
        solutions to problems, apply them to other problems, and explain them to
        other students in simple words.

    <div class="widget fullwidth" id="about-website">
      <p>
        <b>About this website</b><br>
        <br>
        I wrote this website entirely myself, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        for the frontend browser application, and Rust for the backend server, using the Rocket and
        Diesel libraries and PostgreSQL for the database.
        <br>
        <br>
        Yes, I could have used an existing online scheduling app like Calendly
        or Doodle, but I had several reasons for not doing so. First,
        these services use a freemium model that offers limited
        functionality in the base version and requires upgrading to a commercial
        licence to use the full version. By writing the server myself, I can
        ensure that I implement all the functionality I need, and if I ever
        outgrow it, I can upgrade whenever and however I want.
        <br>
        <br>
        A second reason is to set a good example when it comes to privacy. An
        alarming number of websites include invisible HTML tags served by
        Google, Meta, and other companies that allow them to track the pages you
        visit. You can verify this yourself by installing the NoScript extension
        in Firefox (which I highly recommend, by the way). You'll find nothing
        of the sort running on my website. Web tracking aside, I decided early
        on that using a spreadsheet on Office 365 or Google Sheets was not a
        viable method for scheduling, because your name and contact information
        would be visible to the public internet. When and whether you schedule
        tutoring sessions should be no one's business but yours and mine, and my
        server implementation allows me to uphold confidentiality.
        <br>
        <br>
        The third, and perhaps most important reason, was to learn. Though I
        have been proficient in Rust for several years, I had not used either
        Rocket or Diesel before creating this website, and I decided the best
        way to familiarize myself with both libraries was to write a server with
        them. Often, the best way to learn a programming language, framework, or
        library is to use it.
