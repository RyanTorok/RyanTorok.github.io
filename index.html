        After finishing my undergraduate degree in December 2020, I returned to
        Boeing for one final six-month stint, this time working on a few years'
        worth of backlogged updates to the framework responsible for
        running the <i>Starliner</i>'s software qualification tests, whose
        results are formally documented and sent to NASA. The updates
        significantly reduced the amount of human inputs necessary to start the
        tests, eliminating the chance for human error, and reduced the amount of
        waiting time in between them.
        <br>
        <br>
        Eight months after departing Boeing to start my Master's degree at
        Princeton, I was thrilled to watch the <i>Starliner</i> complete its
        second Orbital Flight Test in May 2022, which saw it successfully dock
        with the International Space Station for the first time. I am even more
        looking forward to seeing the spacecraft finally ferry crew to the
        station after over a decade of development and testing, when it will
        carry veteran astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore on the Crewed
        Flight Test in spring 2024. [<a id="boeing_21_back" >back</a>]

      <p id="boeing_alt_19">
        			I worked two internships with Boeing's software team in
summer 2019 and spring-summer 2020. I worked in the testing groups for the
software that runs on the International Space Station as well as Boeing's new
Commercial Crew spacecraft, the <i>Starliner</i>. With the critical
responsibility to protect the spacecraft and crew, this software has some of the
strongest correctness requirements in the world.<br><br>During my 2019
internship, I was located on-site at the office just a few miles from NASA's
Johnson Space Center, and the company organized several trips to JSC for the
roughly 30 interns working for the summer. Pictured is myself in front of the
full-scale model of the Boeing Starliner at JSC building five, where we also had
the opportunity to see mockups of the ISS and the Space Shuttle flight deck. My
group also made trips to see the ISS Software Development Integration Lab
(SDIL), housing duplicates of the decades-old Honeywell computers that run the
ISS (your phone has more processing power), the Neutral Buoyancy Lab where
astronauts train for spacewalks in a 50-foot deep swimming pool, and the ISS
Mission Control Center. To round out the experience, everyone remembers the
mother duck who built a nest outside the building's entrance, whose eggs hatched
into adorable ducklings during the last week of my
internship. [<a id="boeing_19_back" >back</a>]

          Sandcastle is a novel browser fingerprinting defense that uses
          sandboxing techniques to minimize its interference with legitimate
          applications. Sandcastle works by providing an expressive API that web
          applications can use to communicate with the browser, which enables
          the browser to understand to high precision what identifiable
          information leaked by browser APIs is leaked to the network.
          <br>
          <br>
          Meanwhile, information that is not leaked through the API's dedicated
          leakage channel, nicknamed the <i>cashier</i>, remains confined inside
          a carefully designed sandbox that prevents the data leaking through
          other covert channels, including the execution time or the document
          state. This allows the browser to avoid applying other, destructive
          fingerprinting mitigation strategies to API calls within the sandbox,
          like randomizing return values or limiting the number of calls
          using an entropy budget, enabling the browser to robustly defend
          against fingerprinting attacks without harming legitimate
          applications.

          In my final two semesters as an undergraduate, I concluded my Turing
			Scholars honors Computer Science degree with a research project in
			Computer Architecture. The project began at the end of Dr. Calvin
			Lin's graduate research course focusing on hardware prefetching and
			caching. My final project for the course was an entirely new
			prefetcher which utilized register data to improve the accuracy of
			address-correlating prefetchers. The technique showed promise for
			traditional server workloads, but when I transitioned to focus on
			memory latency in graph workloads, I discovered the register-based
			techniques were not producing timely prefetches because of graphs'
			heavy pointer-chasing behavior. Then, I shifted my focus to
			different strategies, and ended up discovering two worthwhile
			techniques, a prefetcher which could extrapolate the neighbor
			indices in the CSR graph memory layout (pictured), and an alternate
			CSR-like layout which allows the graph to achieve better spacial
			locality and suffer fewer cache misses. These two topics became the
			subject of my senior honors thesis in December
			2020. [<a id="csr_back" >back</a>]

          Though I have served as a TA a total of five times across two
          universities, my first TA role at UT Austin is still the most special
          to me. The cohort of 26 students I taught represented the inaugural
          class of UT's new joint Honors Computer Science and Business program,
          and I was granted a chance to interact very closely with my students
          as they braved a difficult course I remembered struggling with
          as a freshman.

          My students frequently complimented my skill at clearly explaining

			logo contest for the course's final project to make the class
			fun. It was particularly rewarding for me to see my former students
			succeed in their future coursework, and I remain friends with
			several of them even after graduating. Picutured here are 23 of my
			26 former students, and had I known they were taking a group photo I

          I have played the cello since age 10, and served as the vice president
of my high school orchestra. We regularly placed in the top 15 schools in the
state of Texas, also performed at prestigious national competitions, including
the Midwest Clinic in Chicago, the ASTA National Orchestra Festival in
Pittsburgh, and the National Orchestra Cup in New York City's Lincoln Center
(unfortunately I was first chair for this one and my bridge broke on stage
during the performance &#8212 everyone was absolutely mortified). I also earned
the right to perform in the 2015-16 and 2016-17 Region 9 Symphony Orchestra,
which accepts the top ten cellists across the North Houston area.
          <br>
          <br>
          My high school orchestra also had its fair share of fun
          traditions, such as the annual Cello Ensemble performance of
          ThePianoGuys' arrangement of <i>Nearer My God to Thee</i>. My most
          memorable orchestra memory has to be when I soloed <i>Silent Night</i>
          with the choir at our combined holiday concert. I continued to perform
          casually throughout college. I love sharing my music outside in campus
          courtyards, especially during the holidays. My favorite piece to
          perform is Luigi Boccherini's Cello Concerto in B&#9837 major, a
          beautiful piece that takes advantage of the instrument's versatility
          and range. Advanced players can learn left hand techniques which allow
          them to play music in higher octaves more commonly played by the
          violin and viola, giving the cello the largest range of any string
          instrument outside the piano. [<a class="misc_back">back</a>]

          Since my time as a music student in high school, I have dedicated
          significant time to composing my own orchestra music. I find writing
          music to be quite theraputic, because while it is primarily a creative
          activity, it also relies on detailed reasoning about factors such as
          chord design, instrument ranges, balance across sections, and the
          timbre of different instruments to discover the best way to translate
          a desired sound in my head into a real score, and it is this process
          that involves the same type of logic I use to solve problems in the
          Computer Science realm. This combination of creative and logical
          thinking makes the writing process the perfect intersection of art and
          science that keeps me entertained for hours.

            <b>A Chillier Kind of Season</b>
            <br>
          You may be surprised to learn that I did not notice how much this
          section's opening line resembles the tenor line from Pachelbel's Canon
          until multiple years after the piece was completed. Early in writing,
          I had planned for <i>Christmas in Boston</i> to take on a very
          different structure, with a few longer movements and a small refrain
          of this section's main melody in between each, making it similar in
          structure to Mussorgsky's
          <i>Pictures at an Exhibition</i>. Though I eventually abandoned this
          structure in favor of several short sections,
          both this section's melody and the piece's title are leftovers from
          that original premise. In fact, the opening line was originally
          intended to resemble walking down a city street, probably in the heat
          of the summer, followed by the entry of the main violin melody
          representing the rapid change from summer to winter one experiences by
          passing through the doors of the piece's eponymous holiday store.

            <b>A Bustling Scene</b>
            <br>
          If I had to choose one, this remains my favorite section. The
          uplifting melody at the opening is downright addictive, and one I
          still catch myself humming at any time of the year. The cross-section
          callbacks with the trombones in the opening melody and the low strings
          in the middle help the tune capture the same lighthearted bounce as
          Leroy Anderson's classic <i>Sleigh Ride</i>. Adding more sound from the
          back of the orchestra on top of the tune interspersed with "The Most
          Wonderful Time of the Year" in the final stretch of this section
          transforms the lighthearted melody into an epic voice that is not
          heard again until the second half of the piece.

            <b>A Peaceful Night</b>
            <br>
            When I was growing up, my parents had a set of electronic bells they
            would hang in our living room each December, and <i>O Come All Ye
            Faithful</i> was the first song it was programmed to play when it
            was powered on. Ever since, it has remained one of my favorite
            Christmas songs, and it was the first holiday tune I learned to play
            on my cello as far back as fifth grade. In writing this section, I
            wanted to give the solo violin a lot of freedom without leaving them
            to play completely on their own. I ended up looking at a guitar
            arrangement of <i>O Come</i> to help guide what chord progression I
            chose for the harp and upper winds in the background. I also like
            how the march feel added by the percussion near the end of the
            section sound unexpected but not out of place. If I have one regret
            about this section, it is that I could have put more effort into the
            intervals between the two violin sections in the final stretch.

            <b>Snow on the Rooftops</b>
            <br>
            Fueled by its mysterious arpeggios, this section is very much a
          fusion of John Williams' <i>Hedwig's Theme</i> from the <i>Harry
          Potter</i> film series and Stephen Flaherty's <i>Once Upon a
          December</i> from the 1997 classic <i>Anastasia</i>. Between slowly
          adding a new instrument to the mix every time the phrase repeats to
          the introduction of the chromatic note sequences that feature
          prominently in the <i>James Bond</i> franchise, this section perfectly
          captures the level of wonder and anticipation I imagine a young child
          would feel looking out their bedroom window on Christmas Eve, seeing a
          blanket of snow on the neighboring houses, wondering when a particular
          red-suited man was going to land on their roof. Oh, and the bassoon
          melody at the end is pretty awesome, too.

            <b>From the Highest Peak</b>
            <br>
            Though I had a rough idea about what I wanted to do with this
            section for a long time, it was challenging to come up with a
            unique-sounding melody that well-captured the thrill of skiing or
            snowboarding down a mountain at impressive speed (I've never done
            either, by the way). I ended up making heavy use of the upper
            strings playing a 2-againt-3 rhythm to make the melody sound fun,
            leaving the low strings to keep the mood of epic
            excitement. Meanwhile, the middle stretch just begs the audience to
            take a break from the intensity and grab a cup of coffee and watch
            the little kids on the bunny slope. If you'd like an excuse to read
            the score, you can look for the harp roll leading into the repeated
            6/4 measure that completely fails to show up in the recording.

          <b>Avalanche</b>
          <br>
          This section got a lot of attention from me, and there are so many fun
          stories I could tell here, like the note in the French Horn section near the
          end that started out as a typo. This section had much more of a story
          in my head during writing than most of the others, with the desceptive
          cadence that ends the previous section representing the collective
          gasp of the skiers noticing they are on the verge of an avalanche,
          that is eventually set off by a bird (represented by the piccolo)
          landing on a tree and causing enough vibration to push the mountain
          over the edge. Following the blare of the avalanche warning horn, the
          section proceeds with a frantic escape down the mountain, highlighted
          by a slew of augmented chords and inconsistent odd phrase
          lengths. The unique chord progression in the final buildup evokes a
          sense of last-ditch confidence before the outcome is left uncertain up
          until the final downbeat. [<a class="cib_sec_back">back</a>]

          <b>Northern Lights: A Winter Ambience</b>
          <br>
          This section was heavily inspired by David Wise's <i>Aquatic
          Ambience</i> from the first entry in the <i>Donkey Kong Country</i>
          game series. In hindsight, I think <i>Northern Lights</i>
          resembles <i>Aquatic Ambience</i> a bit too much, since the heavy use
          of strings for the ambient chord progression makes this section sound
          more like water than snow. The main idea I intended for the start of
          this section, which isn't caputred well by the recording, is that the
          final downbeat of the previous section should reverberate in the hall
          long enough for the upper strings to begin this section without its
          start being heard by the audience. Admittedly, I didn't have many
          ideas for building on top of the peaceful, yet melancholy melody
          provided by the harp and vibraphone. I ended up introducing a rhythmic
          variation of <i>Blue Christmas</i>, followed by a brass doubling of
          the strings' ambient progression to provide a strong "lonely holiday"
          vibe, meant to contrast heavily with the final two sections.

          <b>The Light Reappears</b>

          This section got the least amount of attention from me. I did achieve
          my major goal of including a movement that keeps the peace of the
          previous section but abandons the melancholy feel in favor of a more
          optimistic, reflective one. However, I definitely think I could have
          developed the <i>Greensleeves</i> motif much more than I did. Though
          it was definitely meant to be more minimalistic and reflective, being
          the last chance for the audience to catch their breath before the
          fast-paced final section, I still feel like the middle of this section
          lacks the amount of forward motion I was going for.

          <b>Holiday Spirit in the Air</b>
          <br>
          There's a lot to love here, and a lot I could talk about. Beginning
          with the classic "clock tower bell" note pattern, my goal was to
          capture the same epic feel of <i>Spirit of the Season</i> from the
          classic children's holiday film <i>The Polar Express</i>. Meanwhile,
          the bass line in the low strings was loosely based on that of the
          theme <i>The Reaper's Line of Sight</i> from the game <i>Kid Icarus:
          Uprising</i>. Following the fun rhythmless variant of <i>Deck the
          Halls</i>, we move into a thick, sensitive arrangement of <i>Silent
          Night</i>, which is a subtle nod to my favorite memory from my high
          school orchestra days: when I played <i>Silent Night</i> along with
          the choir at our combined holiday concert. From there until the end of
          the piece, the goal was simply to stack as many classic holiday
          melodies in between the angelic violin runs until every major section
          of the orchestra was playing a different line. Though this section was
          written in only a few days, it definitely provides the illustrious,
          cheerful ending this piece
          deserved. [<a class="cib_sec_back">back</a>]

          I decided I had to include this picture I took in August 2022 from the
          peak of Mount Tammany at the Delaware Water Gap. In the lower-right
          corner, you can see the Delaware River carving through the Kittatinny
          Mountains, paralleled on its right by Interstate 80, whose vehicles
          look like tiny matchbox cars from this 1500-foot vantage point.
          <br>
          <br>
          Hiking up the mountain is an intense climb, with steep inclines and a
          rocky trail where flat places to plant your feet are few and far
          between. After encountering a pair of waterfalls near the mountain's
          base, you find yourself surrounded by trees, giving no indication of
          your elevation for the entire ascent, until it opens up beautifully at
          the peak to the view you see here, making the trek up the mountain
          more than worth it. Though it was a fairly hazy day, you can make out
          the peaks of mountains across the river on the Pennsylvania side that
          are several miles downrange. With the upper-level winds in your face
          and the sheer vastness of the space you can see, the pictures
          absolutely do not do the experience
          justice. [<a class="misc_back">back</a>]
